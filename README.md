# hinfinty_project
This repository contains a port of the project performed in [Controle Hinf por Realimentação de Estados Aplicado a um Robô Omnidirecional](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hyhj96dbqk2cops/TFG_Cezar_Lemos.pdf?dl=0) (originaly in Matlab) to python.

## Robot

In the file `system_data.py` the robot parameters are defined and its state space representation is obtained.

## Project

In the file `project.py` functions to computer the H-infinty controller for an arbitrary system on the general form are defined.

## Simulation

In the notebook `evaluation_SCS` the results of projects performed with the SCS solver are analysed, a controller is chosen and simulations are performed.
