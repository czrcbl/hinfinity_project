It is known that a controller exists if and only if the unique stabilizing solutions to two algebraic Riccati equations are positive definite and the spectral radius of their product is less than γ2. Under these conditions, a parameterization of all controllers solving the problem is given as a linear fractional transformation (LFT) on a contractive, stable, free parameter. The state dimension of the coefficient matrix for the LFT, constructed using the two Riccati solutions, equals that of the plant and has a separation structure reminiscent of classical LQG (i.e. H2) theory. This paper is intended to be of tutorial value, so a standard H2 solution is developed in parallel.","1989-08","2017-02-07 17:04:48","2020-03-24 22:33:53","","831-847","","8","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","authors.library.caltech.edu","","tex.ids: doyleStatespaceSolutionsStandard1989","","/home/cezar/Documents/Zotero/storage/2R8ADU7I/Doyle et al. - 1989 - State-space solutions to standard H2 and H∞ contro.pdf; /home/cezar/Documents/Zotero/storage/T6IF6PZT/Doyle et al. - 1989 - State-space solutions to standard H2 and H∞ contro.pdf; /home/cezar/Documents/Zotero/storage/6V8TMQRE/3087.html; /home/cezar/Documents/Zotero/storage/YVW24SL8/3087.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The focus is on linear systems with static uncertainty on the state matrix. For this class of uncertain systems, the notion of quadratic stability and the related robustness analysis tests are generalized to arbitrary LMI regions. The resulting tests for robust pole clustering are all numerically tractable since they involve solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and cover both unstructured and parameter uncertainty. These analysis results are then applied to the synthesis of dynamic output-feedback controllers that robustly assign the closed-loop poles in a prescribed LMI region. With some conservatism, this problem is again tractable via LMI optimization. In addition, robust pole placement can be combined with other control objectives such as H 2 or H1 performance to capture realist...","1999","2017-02-05 21:04:06","2020-03-24 22:33:50","","2257–2270","","","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CiteSeer","","tex.ids: chilaliRobustPolePlacement1999","","/home/cezar/Documents/Zotero/storage/CI64VUS2/Chilali et al. - 1999 - Robust Pole Placement in LMI Regions.pdf; /home/cezar/Documents/Zotero/storage/GPAS36NX/Chilali et al. - 1999 - Robust Pole Placement in LMI Regions.pdf; /home/cezar/Documents/Zotero/storage/X9VEN2IZ/summary.html; /home/cezar/Documents/Zotero/storage/J2LZ6UWW/summary.html; /home/cezar/Documents/Zotero/storage/74XJ2VDW/Robust Pole Placement in LMI Regions.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
